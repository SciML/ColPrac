That is to say, if the dependency’s API leaks into your API.   There are three ways that this can happen:<ul><li>Reexporting a function that has changed.</li><li>Returning an object of a type whose behavior has changed.</li><li>Subtyping an object that has changed.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="Dropping-support-for-earlier-versions-of-Julia"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Dropping-support-for-earlier-versions-of-Julia">Dropping support for earlier versions of Julia</a><a id="Dropping-support-for-earlier-versions-of-Julia-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Dropping-support-for-earlier-versions-of-Julia" title="Permalink"></a></h3><ul><li>Changing Julia version compatibility must be a non-breaking feature.</li><li>It cannot alone be breaking, since Julia versions that are now unsupported will just never see this newer package release.</li><li>Tagging the change as a Minor release makes it possible to release backported bug fixes for users stuck on the old Julia version.   For instance, if the current release is <code>5.4.0</code>, then we can still go back and release <code>5.3.1</code>.<ul><li>If the package is pre-1.0, minor releases count as breaking. Therefore, tag the release as a patch release unless one intends to</li></ul>support earlier versions of Julia with backports (as needed).</li><li>Dropping support for earlier versions of Julia has a cost - it prevents users on those versions, such as the Long-Term Support version, from using newer releases of your package - so there should usually be a compelling reason to drop support.</li></ul><h3 id="Accidental-breaking-releases"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Accidental-breaking-releases">Accidental breaking releases</a><a id="Accidental-breaking-releases-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Accidental-breaking-releases" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><strong>Do not panic</strong>, these things sometimes slip through.</p><p>It is important to fix it <strong>as soon as possible</strong>, as otherwise people start using the breaking change, and reverting it later causes more problems (c.f.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law"> Murphy&#39;s law</a>).</p><p>To fix it:</p><ol><li>Make a PR which reverts the PR that made the breaking change.</li><li>Bump the Patch version number in the Project.toml.  The breaking API change was a bug, so a Patch release is correct to fix it.</li><li>Merge the PR and release the new version.</li></ol><p>Once the change is reverted, you can take stock and decide what to do. There are generally 2 options:</p><ol><li>Make a new PR to reimplement the feature in a non-breaking way.</li><li>Make a new PR which reverts the reversion, bump the version number to signify it as breaking, and release the new breaking version.</li></ol><h4 id="**Example**"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#**Example**"><strong>Example</strong></a><a id="**Example**-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#**Example**" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Consider a package which is currently on v1.14.2. I made a PR to add a new feature and tagged release v1.15.0. The next evening, we get bug reports that the new feature actually broke lots of real uses.</p><p>Maybe I changed what I thought was an internal function, but one that was actually part of the public API; maybe I accidentally changed the return type, and that was something people depended on. Whatever it was, I broke it, and this was not caught in code review.</p><p>To fix it, I revert the change, and then tag release v1.15.1. Hopefully, I can also add a test to prevent that part of the API from being broken by mistake.</p><p>Now I look at my change again. If I can add the same functionality in a non-breaking way - for example, make a new internal function for my use - then I would do so and tag v1.15.2 or v1.16.0 depending on what had to change.Bu If I cannot make an equivalent non-breaking change, then I would have to make the breaking change and tag v2.0.0.</p><h3 id="Accidental-support-for-an-unsupported-dependency"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Accidental-support-for-an-unsupported-dependency">Accidental support for an unsupported dependency</a><a id="Accidental-support-for-an-unsupported-dependency-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Accidental-support-for-an-unsupported-dependency" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Say you were updating PackageA to support a new version of a dependency, PackageB. For example, you want PackageA v1.1.0 to support PackageB v0.5 and to discontinue supporting v0.4. But say you forgot to remove the compatibility for v0.4, which now no longer works, but other downstream packages that only use v0.4 are now pulling in PackageA v1.1.0 and getting errors.</p><p>Simply releasing a patch for PackageA (v1.1.1) that removes support for v0.4 won&#39;t work in this instance because downstream packages will continue to pull in v1.1.0. It might seem sufficient to just pin the downstream packages to use v1.0.0, but there may be a lot of them to fix, and you can&#39;t be certain you&#39;re aware of them all. It also does nothing to prevent new compatibility issues from arising in the future.</p><p>To fix this, you should still release a patch of PackageA (v1.1.1) that removes support for v0.4 of PackageB, but you should then mark v1.1.0 of PackageA as broken in the registry. To do this, simply make a PR to the registry, adding <code>yanked = true</code> to the <code>Version.toml</code> file under the version causing issues (in this case v1.1.0). This marks the release as broken and prevents it from being used by any package from then on.</p><h2 id="Guidance-on-automatically-enforcing-guidelines"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Guidance-on-automatically-enforcing-guidelines">Guidance on automatically enforcing guidelines</a><a id="Guidance-on-automatically-enforcing-guidelines-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Guidance-on-automatically-enforcing-guidelines" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Many of these guidelines can and should be enforced automatically.</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests">Defining the mergeability of pull requests</a></li><li><strong>Bitbucket:</strong> <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/suggest-or-require-checks-before-a-merge/">Suggest or require checks before a merge</a></li><li><strong>GitLab:</strong> <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15930">Status checks that are required to allow a merge requested [WIP]</a></li></ul><hr/><h2 id="Changes-that-are-not-considered-breaking"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Changes-that-are-not-considered-breaking">Changes that are not considered breaking</a><a id="Changes-that-are-not-considered-breaking-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Changes-that-are-not-considered-breaking" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Everything on this list can, in theory, break users&#39; code. See <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">XKCD#1172</a>. However, we consider changes to these things to be non-breaking from the perspective of package versioning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bugs:</strong> We may make backwards incompatible behavior changes if the current implementation is clearly broken, that is, if it contradicts the documentation or if a well-understood behavior is not properly implemented due to a bug.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internal changes:</strong> Non-public API may be changed or removed.   The public API is defined as all exported symbols, plus any unexported symbols that are explicitly documented as part of the public API, for instance, documented as part of standard usage in the README or hosted documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exception behavior:</strong></p><ul><li>Exceptions may be replaced with non-error behavior.</li></ul><p>For instance, we may change a function to compute a result instead of raising an exception, even if that error is documented.</p><ul><li>Error message text may change.</li><li>Exception types may change unless the exception type for a specific error condition is specified in the documentation.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Floating-point numerical details:</strong> The specific floating-point values may change at any time.   Users should rely only on approximate accuracy, numerical stability, or statistical properties, not on the specific bits computed.</p></li><li><p><strong>New exports</strong>: Adding a new export is never considered breaking.   However, one should consider carefully before exporting a commonly used name that might clash with an existing name (especially, if clashing with <code>Base</code>).</p></li><li><p><strong>New supertypes</strong>:</p><ul><li>A new supertype may be added to an existing hierarchy.</li></ul><p>That is, changing <code>A &lt;: B</code> to <code>A &lt;: B &lt;: C</code> or <code>A &lt;: C &lt;: B</code>.   This includes adding a supertype to something without one, i.e. with supertype <code>Any</code>.</p><ul><li>A <code>Union</code> constant may be replaced by an abstract type that covers all elements of the union.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Changes to the string representation:</strong> The output of <code>print</code>/<code>string</code> or <code>show</code>/<code>repr</code> on a type may change at any time.   Users should not depend on the exact text, but rather on the meaning of the text.   Changing the string representation often breaks downstream packages tests, because it is hard to write test-cases that depend only on meaning (though unit tests with mocking can be shielded from this kind of breaking).</p></li></ul><p>(This guidance on non-breaking changes is inspired by <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/versions">https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/versions</a>.)</p><h1 id="Appendix:"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Appendix:">Appendix:</a><a id="Appendix:-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Appendix:" title="Permalink"></a></h1><h2 id="Marking-a-Repository-as-following-ColPrac:"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Marking-a-Repository-as-following-ColPrac:">Marking a Repository as following ColPrac:</a><a id="Marking-a-Repository-as-following-ColPrac:-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Marking-a-Repository-as-following-ColPrac:" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top, community repositories following ColPrac, should link to it in their <code>README.md</code>.
